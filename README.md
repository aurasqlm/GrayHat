## 🧐 About

**GrayHat** is a dedicated platform designed to educate users on ethical cybersecurity practices. In an age where digital threats are evolving rapidly, we bridge the gap between technical jargon and practical safety.

We promote **legal, responsible security practices** (White/Gray Hat) and strictly prohibit black hat activities. Our goal is to empower users to spot malware, avoid phishing scams, and secure their digital footprint.

> **Note:** This project is for educational purposes only.
